Ōkami presents an amazing look at art direction and using it to it's full advantage with gameplay. Using the celestial brush melds perfectly with the visuals and tone of the game. Even on it's aged original version it holds up amazingly well. The game also looks great in it's HD remasters on all current gen systems making it very accessible to who ever may want to give this game a go.
